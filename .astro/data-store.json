It provides a way to fill time while parked, whether waiting to charge or picking someone up. The catch is that once you sell your Tesla, or simply step out of the car, the games stay behind. For many owners, this can feel like leaving part of the fun on the table.  \n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 offers a natural continuation of that experience. Rather than being tied to a vehicle, it provides a handheld console that can travel anywhere. For those who enjoyed Tesla Arcade, the Switch 2 represents not just a replacement but an expansion: a wider library, portable play, multiplayer, and proper save systems.\n\nWhere Tesla provides curated versions, the Switch 2 delivers the complete package. This means that players can go beyond the shorter parked sessions the car is suited for, and really commit to a game over weeks or months.\n\n\n## Portability beyond the car\nThe most obvious advantage is mobility. Tesla Arcade works only when the car is parked. A Switch 2 can be played anywhere: on the sofa, in bed, while travelling, or during a break at work. The hybrid design allows it to be used as both a handheld console and a docked system for the television.  \n\nIn effect, what began as a novelty for parked charging stops becomes a fully fledged portable console you can rely on every day.\n\n\n## Saves and continuity\nTesla Arcade saves are held locally, with no option to transfer them elsewhere. The Switch 2, like its predecessor, uses cloud saving through Nintendo Switch Online. This ensures that progress is backed up and accessible across devices.  \n\nIf you are used to playing Stardew Valley or Vampire Survivors in your Tesla, you can continue your journey on the Switch without worrying about losing progress. The consistency is reassuring, especially for games that build over many hours.\n\n\n## Multiplayer done properly\nIn a Tesla, multiplayer depends on how many USB ports you can plug controllers into, and it is restricted to local play. The Switch 2 improves on this in several ways. Joy-Con controllers allow two people to play immediately. Pro Controllers add comfort and precision for longer sessions. Local wireless lets multiple Switch consoles link together, and online play is available through Nintendo Switch Online.  \n\nThis means that titles such as Boomerang Fu, Stardew Valley, and Vampire Survivors are no longer confined to quick couch co-op but open up to proper multiplayer experiences with friends and family.\n\n\n## A practical replacement and more\nFor Tesla owners considering selling their car, or for anyone who simply wants to carry the Tesla Arcade experience into a wider context, the Switch 2 offers the most logical upgrade path. It takes the novelty of in-car gaming and expands it into a complete ecosystem, with portable play, cloud saves, downloadable content, and robust multiplayer.  \n\nIn short, the Switch 2 does not just replace Tesla Arcade. It transforms it into something far more useful, flexible, and enjoyable.\n\n--- \n\n## Similar games with more depth\nSeveral titles available in Tesla Arcade are also on the Switch platform, often in more complete forms.  \n\n**Cuphead**  includes the full campaign as well as the Delicious Last Course expansion.  \n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"cuphead\" />\n\n**Stardew Valley** brings farming, building, and community to life with co-operative multiplayer.\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"stardew-valley\" />\n  \n**The Battle of Polytopia** appears with additional tribes and downloadable content.  \n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"the-battle-of-polytopia\" />\n\n**Cat Quest** is joined by Cat Quest II, which allows two-player co-op.  \n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"cat-quest\" />\n\n**Vampire Survivors** is available with its full suite of downloadable content, running smoothly with the option for multiplayer sessions.  \n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"vampire-survivors\" />","src/content/guides/switch-2.mdx","13c2de282474841d","switch-2.mdx",true,"controllers",{"id":38,"data":40,"body":55,"filePath":56,"digest":57,"legacyId":58,"deferredRender":37},{"title":41,"short":42,"coverImage":43,"tags":44,"exclude":20,"ctas":45,"updated":32},"Best Controllers for Tesla Arcade and Home Gaming","A guide to controllers that work well in Tesla vehicles and at home on PC or consoles.","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0193/0208/8804/collections/wirelesscontroller5.png?v=1639742333",[18,38],[46,49,52],{"label":47,"url":48,"rel":25},"Xbox Wireless Controller","https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=xbox+wireless+controller&tag=gamelocnet-21",{"label":50,"url":51,"rel":25},"DualSense (PS5)","https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=ps5+dualsense+controller&tag=gamelocnet-21",{"label":53,"url":54,"rel":25},"8BitDo Pro 2","https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=8bitdo+pro+2&tag=gamelocnet-21","import AffiliateLinks from \"../../components/AffiliateLinks.astro\";\n\nChoosing the right controller makes a real difference when moving from Tesla Arcade to a home or portable setup. While the car supports a limited set of USB and Bluetooth devices, playing the same games on PC, Switch, or other consoles opens up more options. This guide explains the most practical choices and why they matter.\n\n---\n\n## Controllers that work in a Tesla\n\nThe Tesla Arcade supports most modern **wired USB controllers** and some **Bluetooth models**.  \nPopular options include:\n\n- **Xbox Wireless Controller (USB-C or USB-A)**  \n  Recognised quickly by Tesla vehicles and works reliably at home with PC or Xbox.  \n\n- **PlayStation DualSense (PS5)**  \n  Compatible in wired mode. At home, it adds adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, features that Tesla games do not use but PC and PlayStation titles can.  \n\n- **8BitDo Pro 2**  \n  A flexible third-party option with profiles for Switch, PC, Android, and more. Known for comfort and programmability.  \n\n---\n\n## Using the same controller at home\n\nOne of the advantages of starting with a Tesla-compatible controller is that you can continue using it outside the car. For example:\n\n- The **Xbox Wireless Controller** works seamlessly on PC (wired or Bluetooth), Xbox Series X/S, and cloud platforms like Xbox Game Pass.  \n- The **DualSense** integrates best with PlayStation 5 but is increasingly supported on PC titles that use haptics and adaptive triggers.  \n- The **8BitDo Pro 2** is a cross-platform device, making it an excellent choice if you switch between PC, Switch, and mobile.  \n\nThis makes it easy to carry your Tesla setup into a living room console or desktop environment without buying duplicates.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations by scenario\n\n- **If you mainly play on PC and Tesla:** Choose the Xbox Wireless Controller.  \n- **If you own a PlayStation 5:** Stick with the DualSense to benefit from features beyond Tesla.  \n- **If you want maximum flexibility:** Pick the 8BitDo Pro 2 for cross-platform use.  \n\n---\n\n## Where to buy\n\nHere are direct purchase options:\n\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"xbox-controller\" title=\"Xbox Wireless Controller\" />\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"ps5-dualsense\" title=\"PlayStation DualSense (PS5)\" />\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"8bitdo-pro2\" title=\"8BitDo Pro 2\" />\n\n---\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nTesla Arcade is limited in scope, but choosing a controller that also fits into your wider gaming setup saves money and adds convenience. Instead of buying something that works only in the car, it makes sense to invest in hardware you can continue using across multiple platforms.","src/content/guides/controllers.mdx","683255e3b3a54622","controllers.mdx","arcade-replacements",{"id":59,"data":61,"body":77,"filePath":78,"digest":79,"legacyId":80,"deferredRender":37},{"title":62,"short":63,"coverImage":64,"tags":65,"exclude":20,"ctas":67,"updated":32},"Steam Deck vs. Switch 2 vs. PC Build: Which Is the Best Tesla Arcade Replacement?","Comparing three main options to replace Tesla Arcade after selling your car — portability, power, and price.","https://media.easy-peasy.ai/27feb2bb-aeb4-4a83-9fb6-8f3f2a15885e/c2a023c8-5897-448f-a85e-d1f0c10c644b.png",[18,66,19],"comparison",[68,72,74],{"label":69,"url":70,"rel":71},"Steam Deck","https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck","nofollow noopener",{"label":73,"url":24,"rel":25},"Nintendo Switch 2",{"label":75,"url":76,"rel":25},"Compact Gaming PCs","https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=mini+gaming+pc&tag=gamelocnet-21","import AffiliateLinks from \"../../components/AffiliateLinks.astro\";\n\nTesla Arcade offers a unique mix of casual gaming during charging stops and family entertainment in the car.  \nWhen moving away from Tesla ownership, many drivers want to recreate or even improve that experience at home or on the go.  \n\nThere are three main contenders: the **Steam Deck**, the **Nintendo Switch 2**, and a **compact PC build**. Each has strengths and weaknesses depending on your budget and how you like to play.\n\n---\n\n## Portability and convenience\n\n- **Steam Deck**  \n  A powerful handheld PC that runs most Tesla Arcade titles natively through Steam. It also opens up emulation and cloud gaming. Its bulk makes it less portable than a Switch, but it is versatile.\n\n- **Nintendo Switch 2**  \n  Designed from the ground up for portable gaming. Smaller, lighter, and with a robust ecosystem. It provides familiar access to games like *Cuphead*, *Stardew Valley*, and *Vampire Survivors*, often with exclusive extras and multiplayer support.\n\n- **Compact PC build**  \n  The least portable, but the most powerful. A mini-PC with a GPU can run everything Tesla offered and far more. Not practical for travel, but excellent for home setups with a monitor or TV.\n\n---\n\n## Game library and compatibility\n\nTesla Arcade includes a mix of indie and casual games. All three replacement options cover these:\n\n- **Steam Deck**: Direct access to PC versions through Steam and other storefronts.  \n- **Switch 2**: Official Nintendo versions with DLC, cross-save options, and local/online multiplayer.  \n- **PC Build**: Full library without restrictions, plus mods and customisation.  \n\nExamples:  \n\n- **Cuphead** – available on all three.  \n- **Stardew Valley** – best on Switch for portability and co-op, but mods thrive on PC.  \n- **Vampire Survivors** – runs well everywhere; Steam Deck and PC give quicker access to DLC.  \n\n### Cuphead ###\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"cuphead\" />\n### Stardew Valley ###\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"stardew-valley\" />\n### Vampire Survivors ###\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"vampire-survivors\" />\n\n---\n\n## Multiplayer experience\n\n- **Steam Deck**: Local multiplayer is limited (single screen). For full co-op, you need docks or external controllers.  \n- **Switch 2**: Strongest option for multiplayer — detachable Joy-Con, wireless local play, and Nintendo Switch Online.  \n- **PC Build**: Most flexible with online platforms (Steam, Xbox Game Pass, etc.), but less convenient for casual family sessions.  \n\n---\n\n## Budget considerations\n\n- **Steam Deck**: Mid-range. Entry model around £350–£400, with higher storage versions costing more.  \n- **Switch 2**: Expected around £300–£350, with occasional bundles.  \n- **Compact PC build**: Starts at £600–£800 for entry-level, but can easily rise past £1,000 depending on GPU and storage.  \n\n---\n\n## Which should you choose?\n\n- **On a budget and value portability** → Switch 2 is the easiest choice.  \n- **Want PC flexibility and already own a Steam library** → Steam Deck bridges Tesla Arcade and full PC gaming.  \n- **Looking for a permanent home setup with maximum power** → a compact gaming PC build is the clear winner.  \n\n---\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nEach of these paths provides a way to move beyond Tesla Arcade and make the most of your games without the car.  \nThe right choice comes down to how important **portability**, **multiplayer**, and **budget** are for your lifestyle.","src/content/guides/arcade-replacements.mdx","3703a5a32e43d106","arcade-replacements.mdx","cross-saves",{"id":81,"data":83,"body":95,"filePath":96,"digest":97,"legacyId":98,"deferredRender":37},{"title":84,"short":85,"coverImage":86,"tags":87,"exclude":20,"ctas":89,"updated":32},"Cross-Save and Cloud Save: Continuing Progress Beyond Tesla Arcade","A guide to moving your Tesla Arcade game progress to Switch, PC, or consoles, and where cloud saves are supported.","https://freerangestock.com/sample/118905/cloud-upload-vector-icon.jpg",[88,9,19],"saves",[90,92],{"label":91,"url":31,"rel":25},"Nintendo Switch Online Membership",{"label":93,"url":94,"rel":71},"Steam Cloud Information","https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=cloud+save","import AffiliateLinks from \"../../components/AffiliateLinks.astro\";\n\nTesla Arcade is a fun way to play casual and indie titles, but one of its biggest limitations is **save management**.  \nIn most cases, your progress in Tesla Arcade is **stored locally in the car**, with no official export function. That means when you sell your Tesla, or want to move to another platform, you need to understand what *cross-save* and *cloud save* options exist for each title.\n\nThis guide explores the main games available in Tesla Arcade, how saves are handled, and what you can do to continue progress elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Tesla Arcade saves\n- **Local only**: Tesla keeps saves on the vehicle system itself. There is no built-in cloud sync or account-based save transfer.  \n- **No export**: You cannot directly copy save files from the car’s storage to another device.  \n- **Workaround**: The best option is to start fresh on another platform, or rely on titles that support cross-save accounts outside Tesla.  \n\n---\n\n## Which games support cross-save or cloud save?\n\n### Cuphead\n- Tesla: Local-only saves.  \n- PC/Switch/Console: Progress saved per platform.  \n- Cross-save: **Not supported**.

This is one of the easiest to carry over.  \n\n\u003CAffiliateLinks slug=\"the-battle-of-polytopia\" />\n\n---\n\n## General advice\n\n- **Check account-based titles first**: Games like Polytopia that tie progress to an external account are your best chance of carrying saves across.  \n- **Use cloud services where available**: Steam Cloud, Xbox Cloud, and Nintendo Switch Online ensure progress is safe once you move away from Tesla.  \n- **Prepare to restart**: For many Tesla Arcade games, expect to begin fresh on a new platform, but benefit from full versions, DLC, and multiplayer features.  \n\n---\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nTesla Arcade is a fun environment, but it is not designed as a long-term gaming ecosystem.  \nIf you plan to sell your car or want to continue your progress elsewhere, check which titles support account logins or cloud saves.

A used Switch is the most straightforward, a Steam Deck balances price with flexibility, and a mini-PC is a versatile long-term investment.  \n\nEach option costs less than a few months of car payments but gives you years of accessible, portable fun — with more features than Tesla Arcade ever offered.","src/content/guides/budget-upgrade.mdx","1e4ce32e050b670c","budget-upgrade.mdx","games",["Map",145,146,184,185,219,220,264,265,306,307,343,344,380,381,414,415,458,459,503,504,538,539,580,581,613,614,655,656,696,697,730,731,771,772],"2048",{"id":145,"data":147,"filePath":181,"digest":182,"legacyId":183,"deferredRender":37},{"title":145,"short":148,"coverImage":149,"tesla":150,"platforms":154,"saves":172,"features":175,"recommendedHardware":177,"notes":178,"tags":180,"exclude":20},"Swipe-and-merge numbers until you reach 2048 (or beyond).","https://ralfvanveen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Placeholder-_-Glossary.svg",{"available":37,"scope":151,"controllerRequired":20,"localCoop":20,"notes":152},"Classic 4×4 board.",[153],"No controller needed.",{"pc":155,"xbox":162,"playstation":164,"switch":166,"mobile":169},{"available":37,"stores":156,"perks":160},[157,158,159],"steam","gog","humble",[161],"Variants and larger boards",{"available":20,"perks":163},[],{"available":20,"perks":165},[],{"available":37,"perks":167},[168],"Portable play",{"available":37,"perks":170},[171],"Free, lightweight apps on iOS/Android",{"teslaExportSupported":20,"crossSaveNotes":173},[174],"No Tesla → home export.",{"localCoop":20,"onlineCoopNative":20,"onlineCoopWorkaround":176,"controllerRecommended":20},[],[],[179],"Great idle puzzle; home versions offer modes and themes.",[],"src/content/games/2048.mdx","ccc9b43054870888","2048.mdx","backgammon",{"id":184,"data":186,"filePath":216,"digest":217,"legacyId":218,"deferredRender":37},{"title":187,"short":188,"coverImage":149,"tesla":189,"platforms":193,"saves":208,"features":210,"recommendedHardware":212,"notes":213,"tags":215,"exclude":20},"Backgammon","Classic board game of racing and risk.",{"available":37,"scope":190,"controllerRequired":20,"localCoop":37,"notes":191},"Standard rules; casual matches.",[192],"Pass-and-play works well without controllers.",{"pc":194,"xbox":198,"playstation":200,"switch":202,"mobile":205},{"available":37,"stores":195,"perks":196},[157,158,159],[197],"Stronger AIs, online ranked play (varies by title)",{"available":20,"perks":199},[],{"available":20,"perks":201},[],{"available":37,"perks":203},[204],"Local play",{"available":37,"perks":206},[207],"Online play; tutorials; ELO ladders",{"teslaExportSupported":20,"crossSaveNotes":209},[174],{"localCoop":37,"onlineCoopNative":20,"onlineCoopWorkaround":211,"controllerRecommended":20},[],[],[214],"For competitive online, choose a PC/mobile app with rated matchmaking.",[],"src/content/games/backgammon.mdx","f8cecb73b34d9d3e","backgammon.mdx","beach-buggy-racing-2",{"id":219,"data":221,"body":260,"filePath":261,"digest":262,"legacyId":263,"deferredRender":37},{"title":222,"short":223,"coverImage":224,"tesla":225,"platforms":230,"saves":247,"features":251,"recommendedHardware":253,"notes":257,"tags":259,"exclude":20},"Beach Buggy Racing 2","Kart racer with Tesla twist: steering-wheel controls inside the car!
