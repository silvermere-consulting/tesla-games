faqs:
  - question: "Which controllers work across the most devices?"
    answer: "Modern Bluetooth controllers that support XInput or multiple modes, such as many 8BitDo and Xbox-branded pads, tend to work across PC, Steam Deck and some mobile devices. Console-specific controllers like Joy-Cons or DualSense are more limited outside their native systems."
  - question: "Should I go wired or wireless for travel?"
    answer: "Wireless controllers are more convenient on the go, but wired controllers are cheaper and avoid battery issues. A mix can work well: one good wireless pad as your primary controller and one or two wired backups that always ‘just work’."
  - question: "Do I need a separate controller for each platform?"
    answer: "Not always. With the right multi-mode controller, you can often cover PC, Steam Deck and mobile with a single device. Consoles like Switch, Xbox and PlayStation may still benefit from at least one native controller for the best compatibility."
  - question: "What other accessories are worth packing?"
    answer: "For travel, a small USB-C hub, a reliable HDMI cable, a compact dock (for Switch or handheld PCs) and a basic carry case make a huge difference. They turn your handheld or mini PC into a flexible system you can use on hotel TVs or spare monitors."

Great portable gaming is not just about the console or handheld; it’s also about the controllers and small accessories that make playing comfortable everywhere. This guide walks through controller options that work across multiple platforms, plus a short list of travel-friendly accessories that make it much easier to game in rentals, hotels and family homes. We’ll cross-link to where the [games](/games) live, and when a [Switch](/switch), [Steam Deck](/steam-deck), or broader [travel setup](/travel-setups) benefits from the right input devices.

## Controllers that work in a Tesla

The Tesla Arcade supports most modern **wired USB controllers** and some **Bluetooth models**.  
Popular options include:

- **Xbox Wireless Controller (USB-C or USB-A)**  
  Recognised quickly by Tesla vehicles and works reliably at home with PC or Xbox.  

- **PlayStation DualSense (PS5)**  
  Compatible in wired mode. At home, it adds adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, features that Tesla games do not use but PC and PlayStation titles can.  

- **8BitDo Pro 2**  
  A flexible third-party option with profiles for Switch, PC, Android, and more. Known for comfort and programmability.

## Using the same controller at home

One of the advantages of starting with a Tesla-compatible controller is that you can continue using it outside the car. For example:

- The **Xbox Wireless Controller** works seamlessly on PC (wired or Bluetooth), Xbox Series X/S, and cloud platforms like Xbox Game Pass.  
- The **DualSense** integrates best with PlayStation 5 but is increasingly supported on PC titles that use haptics and adaptive triggers.  
- The **8BitDo Pro 2** is a cross-platform device, making it an excellent choice if you switch between PC, Switch, and mobile.  

This makes it easy to carry your Tesla setup into a living room console or desktop environment without buying duplicates.

## Recommendations by scenario

- **If you mainly play on PC and Tesla:** Choose the Xbox Wireless Controller.  
- **If you own a PlayStation 5:** Stick with the DualSense to benefit from features beyond Tesla.  
- **If you want maximum flexibility:** Pick the 8BitDo Pro 2 for cross-platform use.

## Final thoughts

Tesla Arcade is limited in scope, but choosing a controller that also fits into your wider gaming setup saves money and adds convenience. Instead of buying something that works only in the car, it makes sense to invest in hardware you can continue using across multiple platforms.
