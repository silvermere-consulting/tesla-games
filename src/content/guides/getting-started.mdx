# Getting started with Games On The Move

Games On The Move helps you find digital games that run well on portable and at-home hardware — Steam Deck, Switch / Switch 2, handheld PCs, iPad/Android, consoles, cloud, and mobile — and shows where each game is available.

> **Our roots: Tesla Arcade**  
> This project began as a way to rebuild Tesla Arcade line-ups after selling a car. If that’s you, check [/tesla](/tesla) and the guide to [Rebuild your Tesla Arcade library](/guides/rebuild-arcade); compare devices with [Steam Deck vs Switch](/guides/steam-deck-vs-switch). Otherwise, skip ahead — the rest of the site is fully general-purpose.

## Who this guide is for

- Portable gamers using Steam Deck, Switch / Switch 2, handheld PCs, iPad / Android tablets, or phones.
- Players moving between platforms — including ex-Tesla owners — who want their games everywhere.
- Families and travellers looking for reliable “games on the move.”

## How the site is organised

- **Game library**: [/games](/games) — per-game pages with platform availability, notes, and trusted store links.
- **Platform hubs**: start with the right device guide: [Steam Deck](/guides/steam-deck), [Switch](/guides/switch), [iPad](/guides/ipad), [Android](/guides/android), [Cloud gaming](/guides/cloud-gaming).
- **Guides**: [/guides](/guides) — comparisons, accessories, Tesla cluster, and setup recipes.

## Quick start

1. **Pick your main device** — see platform hubs above.  
2. **Browse games** that suit that device in the [game library](/games); each page lists platforms and notes.  
3. **Check where to buy** — per-game pages link to trusted stores (Amazon, Green Man Gaming, Humble, etc.).  
4. **Review cross-save / cloud-save notes** so your progress moves between devices.  
5. **Optimize with guides** — use [accessories](/guides/accessories) and [Steam Deck vs Switch](/guides/steam-deck-vs-switch) to fine-tune your setup.

## Choosing your main device

- [Steam Deck](/guides/steam-deck) — handheld PC with a huge library and flexible settings.  
- [Switch](/guides/switch) — family-friendly, offline-first; good travel choice.  
- [iPad](/guides/ipad) — Apple Arcade, cloud apps, and controller support.  
- [Android](/guides/android) — cloud, emulation, and portable builds on phones/tablets.  
- [Cloud gaming](/guides/cloud-gaming) — stream PC/console games to any screen.

## Buying games and hardware

- Game pages link to authorised stores (Amazon, Green Man Gaming, Humble, etc.); no grey-market keys.
- Hardware and accessories live in the platform guides and the [travel accessories guide](/guides/accessories).

## Stay synced and travel-ready

- On each game page, look for cross-save and cloud-save notes before switching devices.
- For travel, check offline support and controller requirements; see platform guides for battery and network tips.
