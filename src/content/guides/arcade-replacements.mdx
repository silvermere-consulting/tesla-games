Tesla Arcade offers a unique mix of casual gaming during charging stops and family entertainment in the car.  
When moving away from Tesla ownership, many drivers want to recreate or even improve that experience at home or on the go.  

There are three main contenders: the **Steam Deck**, the **Nintendo Switch 2**, and a **compact PC build**. Each has strengths and weaknesses depending on your budget and how you like to play.

---

## Portability and convenience

- **Steam Deck**  
  A powerful handheld PC that runs most Tesla Arcade titles natively through Steam. It also opens up emulation and cloud gaming. Its bulk makes it less portable than a Switch, but it is versatile.

- **Nintendo Switch 2**  
  Designed from the ground up for portable gaming. Smaller, lighter, and with a robust ecosystem. It provides familiar access to games like *Cuphead*, *Stardew Valley*, and *Vampire Survivors*, often with exclusive extras and multiplayer support.

- **Compact PC build**  
  The least portable, but the most powerful. A mini-PC with a GPU can run everything Tesla offered and far more. Not practical for travel, but excellent for home setups with a monitor or TV.

---

## Game library and compatibility

Tesla Arcade includes a mix of indie and casual games. All three replacement options cover these:

- **Steam Deck**: Direct access to PC versions through Steam and other storefronts.  
- **Switch 2**: Official Nintendo versions with DLC, cross-save options, and local/online multiplayer.  
- **PC Build**: Full library without restrictions, plus mods and customisation.  

Examples:  

- **Cuphead** – available on all three.  
- **Stardew Valley** – best on Switch for portability and co-op, but mods thrive on PC.  
- **Vampire Survivors** – runs well everywhere; Steam Deck and PC give quicker access to DLC.

## Multiplayer experience

- **Steam Deck**: Local multiplayer is limited (single screen). For full co-op, you need docks or external controllers.  
- **Switch 2**: Strongest option for multiplayer — detachable Joy-Con, wireless local play, and Nintendo Switch Online.  
- **PC Build**: Most flexible with online platforms (Steam, Xbox Game Pass, etc.), but less convenient for casual family sessions.  

---

## Budget considerations

- **Steam Deck**: Mid-range. Entry model around £350–£400, with higher storage versions costing more.  
- **Switch 2**: Expected around £300–£350, with occasional bundles.  
- **Compact PC build**: Starts at £600–£800 for entry-level, but can easily rise past £1,000 depending on GPU and storage.  

---

## Which should you choose?

- **On a budget and value portability** → Switch 2 is the easiest choice.  
- **Want PC flexibility and already own a Steam library** → Steam Deck bridges Tesla Arcade and full PC gaming.  
- **Looking for a permanent home setup with maximum power** → a compact gaming PC build is the clear winner.

## Final thoughts

Each of these paths provides a way to move beyond Tesla Arcade and make the most of your games without the car.  
The right choice comes down to how important **portability**, **multiplayer**, and **budget** are for your lifestyle.
