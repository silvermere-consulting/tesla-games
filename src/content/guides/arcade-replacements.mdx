faqs:
  - question: "Which device is closest to the Tesla Arcade experience?"
    answer: "If you mainly played indie and AA titles, a Steam Deck or Switch 2 will feel closest to Tesla’s arcade, with quick resume, portable play and simple controllers. If you want maximum flexibility, a small form-factor PC build connected to a TV gives you a full desktop environment with Steam, Game Pass and more."
  - question: "What if I already own several PC games?"
    answer: "If most of your library is on Steam, Epic or Game Pass, a Steam Deck or a compact gaming PC is usually the best fit. You’ll get access to your existing purchases and can often play with cloud saves if the games support them."
  - question: "Is a portable PC build too much hassle for travel?"
    answer: "A mini PC or ITX build is less grab-and-go than a Switch or Steam Deck, but it’s perfect if you spend longer periods in one place and want the full desktop experience. For short journeys, handhelds are usually easier; for longer stays, a compact PC build is more flexible."
  - question: "How should I choose between Steam Deck, Switch 2 and a PC?"
    answer: "Start with your library and your play style. If you like Nintendo exclusives and family games, lean towards Switch 2. If you own lots of PC titles and like tinkering, Steam Deck or a small gaming PC is ideal. If you want the simplest, family-friendly option, Switch usually wins."

Selling or changing your car does not mean losing your gaming habit. This guide compares three main ways to replace the Tesla Arcade: a handheld like the [Steam Deck](/steam-deck), a [Nintendo Switch 2](/switch), or a compact gaming PC build you can move between rooms or take on [travel setups](/travel-setups). We’ll look at budget, library, performance and how each option fits into real-world play—plus how they connect back to the broader [game library](/games) you already enjoy.

## Portability and convenience

- **Steam Deck**  
  A powerful handheld PC that runs most Tesla Arcade titles natively through Steam. It also opens up emulation and cloud gaming. Its bulk makes it less portable than a Switch, but it is versatile.

- **Nintendo Switch 2**  
  Designed from the ground up for portable gaming. Smaller, lighter, and with a robust ecosystem. It provides familiar access to games like *Cuphead*, *Stardew Valley*, and *Vampire Survivors*, often with exclusive extras and multiplayer support.

- **Compact PC build**  
  The least portable, but the most powerful. A mini-PC with a GPU can run everything Tesla offered and far more. Not practical for travel, but excellent for home setups with a monitor or TV.

## Game library and compatibility

Tesla Arcade includes a mix of indie and casual games. All three replacement options cover these:

- **Steam Deck**: Direct access to PC versions through Steam and other storefronts.  
- **Switch 2**: Official Nintendo versions with DLC, cross-save options, and local/online multiplayer.  
- **PC Build**: Full library without restrictions, plus mods and customisation.  

Examples:  

- **Cuphead** – available on all three.  
- **Stardew Valley** – best on Switch for portability and co-op, but mods thrive on PC.  
- **Vampire Survivors** – runs well everywhere; Steam Deck and PC give quicker access to DLC.

## Multiplayer experience

- **Steam Deck**: Local multiplayer is limited (single screen). For full co-op, you need docks or external controllers.  
- **Switch 2**: Strongest option for multiplayer — detachable Joy-Con, wireless local play, and Nintendo Switch Online.  
- **PC Build**: Most flexible with online platforms (Steam, Xbox Game Pass, etc.), but less convenient for casual family sessions.  

---

## Budget considerations

- **Steam Deck**: Mid-range. Entry model around £350–£400, with higher storage versions costing more.  
- **Switch 2**: Expected around £300–£350, with occasional bundles.  
- **Compact PC build**: Starts at £600–£800 for entry-level, but can easily rise past £1,000 depending on GPU and storage.  

---

## Which should you choose?

- **On a budget and value portability** → Switch 2 is the easiest choice.  
- **Want PC flexibility and already own a Steam library** → Steam Deck bridges Tesla Arcade and full PC gaming.  
- **Looking for a permanent home setup with maximum power** → a compact gaming PC build is the clear winner.

## Final thoughts

Each of these paths provides a way to move beyond Tesla Arcade and make the most of your games without the car.  
The right choice comes down to how important **portability**, **multiplayer**, and **budget** are for your lifestyle.
