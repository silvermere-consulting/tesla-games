## Why pick iPad for Tesla-style play

- Great battery life and travel-friendly form factor.
- Strong catalog via Apple Arcade plus cloud apps (GeForce NOW, Xbox, PS Remote).
- Easy to pair controllers and AirPlay to hotel TVs when Wi‑Fi cooperates.

## How to play Tesla Arcade favourites

- **Native / Apple Arcade:** Check if your game is on Apple Arcade (e.g. `sonic-the-hedgehog` classics) or the App Store. Most titles support controllers.
- **Cloud streaming:** Install **GeForce NOW** or **Xbox Cloud Gaming (browser/PWA)** for PC/console versions like `cuphead` or `stardew-valley`.
- **Remote play:** If you own a console or gaming PC, use **PS Remote Play** or **Steam Link** to stream your existing library.

## Cross-save and progression

- Cloud platforms keep progress when you sign in with the same account (Steam/Xbox/PSN/Epic).
- Apple Arcade saves stay on Apple devices; use cloud versions if you want cross-platform sync.
- For Steam → cloud, verify the title has Steam Cloud enabled before travelling.

## Controllers and input

- Pair a **Bluetooth controller** (Xbox, DualSense, 8BitDo); iPadOS supports profiles and remapping.
- For table play, add a **stand**; for couch/bed, use a **clip** or **lap desk**.
- Keep a **USB-C cable** handy for low-latency play and charging on flights.

## Network tips

- Prefer hotel Ethernet + travel router when possible; otherwise use 5 GHz Wi‑Fi or a local hotspot.
- Drop cloud resolution to 720p/60 for stability; cap bitrate when on LTE/5G.

## Quick setup checklist

1) Install GeForce NOW / Xbox Cloud as needed.  
2) Sign in to Steam/Xbox/PSN/Epic for cross-save.  
3) Pair controller and map touch controls only if required.  
4) Test one latency-sensitive title before travelling.
