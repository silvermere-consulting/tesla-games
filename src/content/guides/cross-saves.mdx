Tesla Arcade is a fun way to play casual and indie titles, but one of its biggest limitations is **save management**.  
In most cases, your progress in Tesla Arcade is **stored locally in the car**, with no official export function. That means when you sell your Tesla, or want to move to another platform, you need to understand what *cross-save* and *cloud save* options exist for each title.

This guide explores the main games available in Tesla Arcade, how saves are handled, and what you can do to continue progress elsewhere.

## Understanding Tesla Arcade saves
- **Local only**: Tesla keeps saves on the vehicle system itself. There is no built-in cloud sync or account-based save transfer.  
- **No export**: You cannot directly copy save files from the car’s storage to another device.  
- **Workaround**: The best option is to start fresh on another platform, or rely on titles that support cross-save accounts outside Tesla.

### The Battle of Polytopia
- Tesla: Local-only saves.  
- PC/Mobile: Progress tied to your Polytopia account.  
- Cross-save: **Yes, supported** if you log in with the same account on PC or mobile. This is one of the easiest to carry over.

## General advice

- **Check account-based titles first**: Games like Polytopia that tie progress to an external account are your best chance of carrying saves across.  
- **Use cloud services where available**: Steam Cloud, Xbox Cloud, and Nintendo Switch Online ensure progress is safe once you move away from Tesla.  
- **Prepare to restart**: For many Tesla Arcade games, expect to begin fresh on a new platform, but benefit from full versions, DLC, and multiplayer features.

## Final thoughts

Tesla Arcade is a fun environment, but it is not designed as a long-term gaming ecosystem.  
If you plan to sell your car or want to continue your progress elsewhere, check which titles support account logins or cloud saves. For others, embrace the opportunity to restart with expanded versions that offer more depth, multiplayer, and downloadable content.
