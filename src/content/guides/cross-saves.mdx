faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between cross-save and cross-play?"
    answer: "Cross-save is about your game progress travelling between platforms. Cross-play is about who you can play with online. A title can support one, both, or neither, so always check the game’s official FAQ or store page."
  - question: "Do I always need an online account for cross-save?"
    answer: "Typically yes. Cross-save usually relies on a publisher, platform or account system that stores your progress in the cloud, such as Steam, Battle.net or a game-specific account. You’ll usually need to log in on each device to sync your saves."
  - question: "Can I move my Tesla game saves to other platforms?"
    answer: "In most cases, Tesla builds are standalone and do not expose save files or link directly to external accounts. If the game supports cross-save via its own account system, you may be able to continue progress on other platforms by logging in there, but it is not guaranteed."
  - question: "What should I do if a game doesn’t support cross-save at all?"
    answer: "If cross-save is not supported, your only real option is to restart on the new platform. Focus on games that are easy to replay, or view it as a fresh run with different choices or difficulty settings."

One of the biggest questions when you leave a platform behind is, “Can I keep my progress?” This guide walks through how cross-save and cloud saves work across PC, Switch, Steam Deck and other consoles, what’s possible if you’ve been playing in your car, and how to set yourself up so future platform shifts are much less painful. We’ll point you to where the [games](/games) live now, and when a [Steam Deck](/steam-deck) or [Switch](/switch) helps the most.

## Understanding Tesla Arcade saves
- **Local only**: Tesla keeps saves on the vehicle system itself. There is no built-in cloud sync or account-based save transfer.  
- **No export**: You cannot directly copy save files from the car’s storage to another device.  
- **Workaround**: The best option is to start fresh on another platform, or rely on titles that support cross-save accounts outside Tesla.

## General advice

- **Check account-based titles first**: Games like Polytopia that tie progress to an external account are your best chance of carrying saves across.  
- **Use cloud services where available**: Steam Cloud, Xbox Cloud, and Nintendo Switch Online ensure progress is safe once you move away from Tesla.  
- **Prepare to restart**: For many Tesla Arcade games, expect to begin fresh on a new platform, but benefit from full versions, DLC, and multiplayer features.

## Final thoughts

Tesla Arcade is a fun environment, but it is not designed as a long-term gaming ecosystem.  
If you plan to sell your car or want to continue your progress elsewhere, check which titles support account logins or cloud saves. For others, embrace the opportunity to restart with expanded versions that offer more depth, multiplayer, and downloadable content.
