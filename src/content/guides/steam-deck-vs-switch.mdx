## TL;DR

- **Pick Steam Deck** if you want PC flexibility, cloud apps, and mod support.  
- **Pick Switch** if you want the simplest family setup with offline-friendly titles.

## Library and compatibility

- **Steam Deck:** Runs most PC indies and Tesla favourites (`cuphead`, `stardew-valley`) natively; Proton fills gaps. Cloud apps add Xbox/PC libraries.
- **Switch:** Strong first-party and family titles; check for specific Tesla matches on the eShop.

## Cross-save and progression

- **Deck:** Use Steam Cloud; add GeForce NOW/Xbox Cloud for shared saves across devices.  
- **Switch:** Nintendo cloud saves where supported; otherwise local only.

## Portability and battery

- **Deck:** Heavier; tune TDP/refresh to extend flights. Needs PD charger/power bank.  
- **Switch:** Lighter; great standby and family-friendly controls out of the box.

## Docked and travel setups

- **Deck:** USB-C hub + HDMI/Ethernet for hotels; supports Bluetooth controllers easily.  
- **Switch:** Travel dock + Pro Controller; works well on any TV with minimal config.

## Recommendation by player type

- **PC/Cloud-first:** Steam Deck.  
- **Family/local co-op:** Switch.  
- **Road warriors:** Either—Deck for flexibility, Switch for simplicity.
