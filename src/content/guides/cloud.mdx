Looking for full details? See the deeper **[Cloud gaming guide](/guides/cloud-gaming)**. This quickstart covers the essentials to get you playing fast.

## Choose a service

- **GeForce NOW:** Best for existing Steam/Epic libraries.  
- **Xbox Cloud Gaming:** Strong for Game Pass and indies.  
- **Steam Link / Moonlight / Sunshine:** Host it yourself for lowest latency.

## Network basics

- Prefer **Ethernet + travel router** in hotels; otherwise 5 GHz close to the AP.
- Start at **720p/60** with capped bitrate; raise only if stable.
- Avoid VPNs that add latency; keep servers in your region.

## Controllers

- Use **Xbox or DualSense** for widest compatibility; 8BitDo for compact travel.
- Pair via Bluetooth; switch to **wired USB-C** for latency-sensitive games.

## Quick setup checklist

1) Pick a service and sign in with your library accounts.  
2) Set 720p/60, enable low-latency mode, cap bitrate.  
3) Pair controller; test one action game before travelling.  
4) Pack charger, short USB-C, and (optional) travel router.
