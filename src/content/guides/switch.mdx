## Why Switch for portable play (and Tesla-style gaming)

- Great for families and local co-op; most games play well offline for flights and road trips.
- Lightweight, durable hardware with a huge digital catalog and physical carts.
- Simple docked/tabletop/handheld modes with minimal setup.
- Solid Tesla Arcade replacement for players who want simple, family-friendly ports.

## Tesla Arcade favourites on Switch

- Check the eShop for matches like `stardew-valley`, `cat-quest`, and similar indies.
- Many classic platformers and racers have Switch ports; verify Joy-Con or Pro Controller support.
- For missing titles, consider cloud versions carefully—latency may vary per region.

## Save management and accounts

- Use **Switch Online cloud saves** where supported; some games require manual local backups.
- Keep one primary profile to avoid scattered saves; set your home console for offline access.
- Sync controllers and re-download saves before travelling.

## Play modes and controllers

- **Handheld:** Best for single-player and quick sessions.  
- **Tabletop:** Pair a **Switch stand** and external controller for better ergonomics.  
- **Docked:** Use a travel dock + HDMI for hotel TVs; keep a long USB-C cable handy.

## Travel-friendly accessories

- **Carrying case + screen protector** for daily protection.
- **Pro Controller** or **8BitDo** pad for better sticks/triggers.
- **Compact travel dock** with HDMI; **Ethernet adapter** if hotel Wi‑Fi is unreliable.
- **High-endurance microSD** for offline installs; bring a **PD charger** for flights.

## Quick setup checklist

1) Buy/download key titles and sync cloud saves before you leave.  
2) Pair controllers; pack a stand for tabletop play.  
3) Test dock + HDMI on your TV to confirm it negotiates correctly.  
4) Add a travel charger and Ethernet/USB hub to handle hotel networks.
