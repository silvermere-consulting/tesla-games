Selling your Tesla does not mean you have to leave the games behind. Tesla Arcade is built on a library of indie and casual favourites that are widely available on other platforms — often with **extras, DLC, and multiplayer options** the car version never offered.  

This guide highlights budget-friendly upgrade paths to keep those games in your life without breaking the bank.

## Option 1: A Used Nintendo Switch

- **Price range**: ~£150–£200 (used or refurbished).  
- **Why it works**: Switch carries many Tesla Arcade titles — *Cuphead*, *Stardew Valley*, *Boomerang Fu*, *Cat Quest*, *Vampire Survivors*.  
- **Extras**: Portable design, couch co-op, access to Nintendo Switch Online for cloud saves and online multiplayer.

## Option 2: Steam Deck (Refurbished)

- **Price range**: ~£250–£350 for refurbished models direct from Steam.  
- **Why it works**: Full PC experience in handheld form. Nearly every Tesla title is available through Steam or Game Pass.  
- **Extras**: Access to your entire PC library, mods, and emulation. Works docked to a TV for living room play.

## Option 3: Mini Gaming PC

- **Price range**: ~£300–£500 for a budget-friendly build (e.g. Gigabyte Brix, MinisForum, or used desktops).  
- **Why it works**: Runs the PC versions of Tesla games at higher quality. Perfect if you already have a monitor or TV.  
- **Extras**: Expandable, handles work and browsing as well as games, and allows easy controller pairing.

## Accessories that help

- **Controllers**: Xbox Wireless Controller, PS5 DualSense, or 8BitDo Pro 2 for multi-platform use.  
- **Subscription services**: Xbox Game Pass or Humble Choice can cheaply fill in gaps in your Tesla library.  
- **Cloud saves**: Steam Cloud and Nintendo Switch Online ensure progress is safe.

## Final thoughts

If you’ve sold your Tesla but miss the games, there are affordable ways to bring them back. A used Switch is the most straightforward, a Steam Deck balances price with flexibility, and a mini-PC is a versatile long-term investment.  

Each option costs less than a few months of car payments but gives you years of accessible, portable fun — with more features than Tesla Arcade ever offered.
