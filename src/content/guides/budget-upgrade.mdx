faqs:
  - question: "What’s the cheapest way to get back to similar games after selling my car?"
    answer: "A used Switch or older Switch model, plus a selection of second-hand games, is often the most affordable way to recreate a casual gaming library. Refurbished handheld PCs or previous-gen consoles can also be very cost-effective."
  - question: "Is it worth buying refurbished consoles or handhelds?"
    answer: "Yes, provided you buy from a reputable retailer with a warranty. Refurbished hardware can significantly reduce costs while still offering a great experience, especially for indie and AA titles that don’t need cutting-edge specs."
  - question: "Should I prioritise hardware or games with a tight budget?"
    answer: "Get to ‘good enough’ on hardware, then focus most of your budget on games. A mid-range or older console with a great library will bring more enjoyment than an overpowered device with only one or two titles."
  - question: "Are subscription services good value for portable gaming?"
    answer: "Services like Game Pass, PlayStation Plus or bundled game libraries can be excellent value if you play frequently and don’t mind rotating titles. For long-term favourites, owning the game outright is still usually the best approach."

If you’ve sold your Tesla or simply want to spend less on hardware, you can still have a great portable gaming setup without a premium budget. This guide walks through practical upgrade paths using used consoles, refurbished handhelds and smart game choices so you can keep playing on the move without overspending. We’ll point to the best values in the [game library](/games) and where a [Switch](/switch), [Steam Deck](/steam-deck), or smart [travel setup](/travel-setups) makes sense.

## Option 3: Mini Gaming PC

- **Price range**: ~£300–£500 for a budget-friendly build (e.g. Gigabyte Brix, MinisForum, or used desktops).  
- **Why it works**: Runs the PC versions of Tesla games at higher quality. Perfect if you already have a monitor or TV.  
- **Extras**: Expandable, handles work and browsing as well as games, and allows easy controller pairing.

## Accessories that help

- **Controllers**: Xbox Wireless Controller, PS5 DualSense, or 8BitDo Pro 2 for multi-platform use.  
- **Subscription services**: Xbox Game Pass or Humble Choice can cheaply fill in gaps in your Tesla library.  
- **Cloud saves**: Steam Cloud and Nintendo Switch Online ensure progress is safe.

## Final thoughts

If you’ve sold your Tesla but miss the games, there are affordable ways to bring them back. A used Switch is the most straightforward, a Steam Deck balances price with flexibility, and a mini-PC is a versatile long-term investment.  

Each option costs less than a few months of car payments but gives you years of accessible, portable fun — with more features than Tesla Arcade ever offered.
