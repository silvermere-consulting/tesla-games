## Why cloud for portable and Tesla replacements

- No need to rebuy hardware; stream your existing PC/console library to handhelds, tablets, or laptops.
- Great fallback when you sell your Tesla but still want the same titles on the road.
- Easy to pair with portable screens, travel routers, and battery packs.

## Best services for Tesla Arcade favourites

- **GeForce NOW:** Strong for Steam/PC libraries; good latency if you stay near regional servers.
- **Xbox Cloud Gaming:** Fast for Xbox Game Pass titles and many indies; works in browser/PWA.
- **Steam Link / Moonlight / Sunshine:** Best quality when you host the stream on your own PC.

## Cross-save and accounts

- Sign in with the same Steam/Xbox/PSN/Epic account you use at home to keep progress synced.
- Verify cloud-save support per title (Steam Cloud toggle; Xbox/PlayStation cloud saves).
- Use the same region and server for consistent latency when travelling.

## Network setup tips

- Prefer Ethernet + travel router in hotels; otherwise 5 GHz Wi‑Fi close to the access point.
- Target 720p/60 for stability on variable hotel or hotspot connections; raise to 1080p+ only on solid bandwidth.
- Keep a **USB-C power bank** and **short cables** to avoid brownouts mid-session.

## Controllers and ergonomics

- Use an **Xbox or DualSense controller** for widest compatibility; 8BitDo is solid for compact travel.
- Add a **clip/kickstand** for phones and tablets; consider a **lap desk** for longer cloud sessions.

## Quick start

1) Pick a service (GeForce NOW / Xbox Cloud) and sign in with your library accounts.  
2) Set graphics to 720p/60, cap bitrate, and enable low-latency mode.  
3) Pair your controller; test one input-latency-heavy game before you travel.  
4) Pack power + networking: router (if needed), cables, and a reliable power bank.
