## Step 1: Map your games

- List your Tesla Arcade titles and find equivalents in our `/games` library.
- Note which platforms you own (Steam, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation) to avoid rebuying.

## Step 2: Pick your devices

- **Steam Deck/PC:** Best for broad compatibility and mods.  
- **Switch:** Easiest for family/local co-op; great offline.  
- **iPad/Android:** Flexible with cloud and remote play.  
- **Cloud-first:** Use GeForce NOW/Xbox Cloud if you prefer streaming to buying hardware.

## Step 3: Secure saves and accounts

- Enable **Steam Cloud** and platform cloud saves before you sell or reset devices.
- Keep Xbox/PSN/Steam logins handy; use the same region to avoid DLC/cross-save issues.

## Step 4: Install and test

- Download key titles on each device; verify controller support.
- For cloud, start at 720p/60 with capped bitrate; test one latency-sensitive game.
- For handhelds, pack a **PD charger**, **stand/dock**, and **controller** for co-op.

## Step 5: Pack travel essentials

- Power (bank + wall charger), cables, hub/dock, HDMI, case, and a compact controller.
- Optional: travel router for hotel Ethernet, screen protector, cable organiser.

## Keep it synced

- Use the same account across services to keep progress in sync.
- Recheck saves before trips; hotels and flights are where sync gaps show up.
