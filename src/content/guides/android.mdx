## Why pick Android for Tesla-style play

- Widest app and cloud options: GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud, Steam Link, Moonlight/Sunshine.
- Works with phones and tablets, so you can repurpose a spare device for travel.
- Flexible storage and sideloading for emulation when permitted.

## How to play Tesla Arcade favourites

- **Cloud streaming:** Use **GeForce NOW** or **Xbox Cloud Gaming** to access PC/console versions of `cuphead`, `stardew-valley`, and other Tesla staples.
- **Remote play:** Stream from your PC with **Steam Link** or **Moonlight/Sunshine**; from consoles with **PS Remote Play** or **Xbox remote play**.
- **Native Android:** Some titles (e.g., classic platformers or indie hits) exist on the Play Store; check controller support before buying.

## Cross-save and progression

- Cloud platforms preserve progress when you use the same account on each device.
- For Steam streaming, ensure **Steam Cloud** is enabled so saves sync between desktop and handheld sessions.
- Xbox/PlayStation remote play will sync through their respective networks automatically.

## Controllers and input

- Pair a **Bluetooth controller** (Xbox, DualSense, 8BitDo). Many Android handhelds support direct USB-C.
- Use a **phone/tablet clip** or **kickstand case** to avoid wrist strain; bring a short USB-C cable for wired play.
- Map touch controls only when a game lacks native controller support.

## Network tips

- Prefer 5 GHz Wi‑Fi or a travel router; avoid crowded 2.4 GHz networks in hotels.
- For LTE/5G, cap bitrate and resolution (720p/60) for stable sessions.
- Test at home with the same network profile you’ll use on the road.

## Quick setup checklist

1) Install GeForce NOW / Xbox Cloud apps or add them as PWAs.  
2) Pair your controller and verify low-latency mode if available.  
3) Sign in to Steam/Xbox/PSN for cross-save continuity.  
4) Do a short latency test with one action-heavy title.
