faqs:
  - question: "What’s the best portable setup for local multiplayer?"
    answer: "A Switch or Switch 2 is usually the simplest option for quick local multiplayer, thanks to detachable controllers and many couch co-op titles. A Steam Deck or mobile PC paired with a TV and a few controllers is ideal if you want access to your PC library."
  - question: "How many controllers do I realistically need?"
    answer: "For most families, two controllers cover a lot of use cases. If you regularly host friends or want four-player party games like Boomerang Fu, budgeting for four compatible controllers makes life easier."
  - question: "Can I mix and match controllers across devices?"
    answer: "Sometimes. Many Bluetooth controllers work across PC, Steam Deck and mobile devices, but not all will pair with consoles like Switch, PS5 or Xbox. When choosing ‘universal’ controllers, always check supported platforms on the product page."
  - question: "Is local multiplayer better than online play for travel?"
    answer: "For travel, local multiplayer is often more reliable because you are not dependent on hotel or mobile data quality. You can set up in a living room or holiday rental, hand out controllers and start playing without worrying about latency."

## Why expand beyond Tesla Arcade?

- **More players**: Tesla supports two controllers comfortably, sometimes more with a hub. At home, Switch and PC versions support 4+ players.  
- **Bigger screens**: A living room TV makes a huge difference for chaotic multiplayer titles.  
- **Session length**: No time pressure from charging stops. Games can stretch into hours.  
- **Features unlocked**: Console and PC versions often include updates, DLC, and online play not available in Tesla.

## Boomerang Fu

- **Tesla version**: Fun in short bursts, limited to small-scale local play.  
- **Switch/PC version**: Supports up to six players, with expanded arenas and power-ups. It quickly becomes a party staple.

## Hardware to make it work

- **Extra controllers**: Xbox Wireless Controllers, DualSense, or 8BitDo Pro 2 are all excellent choices.  
- **Docking station (Switch/Steam Deck)**: Lets you play on the TV with multiple controllers.  
- **Portable projector or second monitor**: Take the living room party vibe to different spaces.

## Recommended setups

- **Budget friendly**: Use a Switch 2 with two Joy-Cons and an extra pair of controllers.  
- **Mid-range**: Steam Deck or compact gaming PC hooked up to the TV, four controllers, and local co-op enabled.  
- **Premium**: Dedicated gaming PC with HDMI to TV, multiple high-end controllers, and DLC packs installed.

## Final thoughts

Tesla Arcade is a great way to introduce games like *Boomerang Fu* and *Vampire Survivors*. But once you step outside the car, those same titles can anchor **full party sessions**, turning a quick charging-stop diversion into an evening of shared fun.  

With the right setup and a few extra controllers, Tesla Arcade favourites evolve into living room classics.
