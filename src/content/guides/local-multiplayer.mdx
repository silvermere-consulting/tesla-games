Tesla Arcade gives you a taste of local co-op fun in a parked car. Games like **Boomerang Fu** and **Vampire Survivors** become quick distractions while charging, but the format is naturally limited by screen size, input options, and play session length.  

At home, those same titles expand into **full living room party games**, perfect for family nights or gatherings with friends. This guide explains how to move from car-based co-op to proper couch multiplayer, and what gear helps make the most of it.

---

## Why expand beyond Tesla Arcade?

- **More players**: Tesla supports two controllers comfortably, sometimes more with a hub. At home, Switch and PC versions support 4+ players.  
- **Bigger screens**: A living room TV makes a huge difference for chaotic multiplayer titles.  
- **Session length**: No time pressure from charging stops. Games can stretch into hours.  
- **Features unlocked**: Console and PC versions often include updates, DLC, and online play not available in Tesla.  

---

## Boomerang Fu

- **Tesla version**: Fun in short bursts, limited to small-scale local play.  
- **Switch/PC version**: Supports up to six players, with expanded arenas and power-ups. It quickly becomes a party staple.

## Vampire Survivors

- **Tesla version**: Solo or basic co-op, limited save features.  
- **PC/Switch/Console version**: Adds full multiplayer support, downloadable content, and cross-platform save features (PC/Xbox). Perfect for marathon sessions.

## Hardware to make it work

- **Extra controllers**: Xbox Wireless Controllers, DualSense, or 8BitDo Pro 2 are all excellent choices.  
- **Docking station (Switch/Steam Deck)**: Lets you play on the TV with multiple controllers.  
- **Portable projector or second monitor**: Take the living room party vibe to different spaces.  

---

## Recommended setups

- **Budget friendly**: Use a Switch 2 with two Joy-Cons and an extra pair of controllers.  
- **Mid-range**: Steam Deck or compact gaming PC hooked up to the TV, four controllers, and local co-op enabled.  
- **Premium**: Dedicated gaming PC with HDMI to TV, multiple high-end controllers, and DLC packs installed.

## Final thoughts

Tesla Arcade is a great way to introduce games like *Boomerang Fu* and *Vampire Survivors*. But once you step outside the car, those same titles can anchor **full party sessions**, turning a quick charging-stop diversion into an evening of shared fun.  

With the right setup and a few extra controllers, Tesla Arcade favourites evolve into living room classics.
