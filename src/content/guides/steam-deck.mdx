## Why Steam Deck for portable play (and Tesla replacements)

- Runs most PC and indie hits natively or via Proton; great for portable-first libraries.
- Dock to a TV for couch play; undock for planes, trains, and hotels.
- Mature controller support with built-in trackpads for mouse-heavy games.
- Strong option for ex-Tesla owners rebuilding Arcade line-ups on a handheld PC.

## How to get your games

- **Steam library:** Install your PC versions for native play (e.g., `cuphead`, `stardew-valley`). Enable Proton where needed.
- **Cloud:** Add GeForce NOW or Xbox Cloud as Non-Steam shortcuts for titles you don’t own on Steam.
- **Local streaming:** Use **Steam Remote Play** to stream from a gaming PC at home if performance is better there.

## Cross-save and progression

- Check **Steam Cloud** status per game before travelling; toggle it on for each title.
- For cloud services, sign into the same Steam/Xbox/PSN/Epic account to keep progress synced.
- Avoid mixing regional accounts; it can break DLC and cross-save.

## Performance and battery tips

- Cap TDP and refresh rate (40–45 fps) to stretch battery life on flights.
- Drop resolution to 800p and use FSR for smoother handheld play.
- Bring a **65W+ USB-C PD** charger and a short cable; pack a power bank for long trips.

## Best accessories for travel

- **Protective case + screen protector** for transit.
- **USB-C hub** or dock for hotel/TV play; add **HDMI** and **Ethernet** for stability.
- **Compact controller** (8BitDo/Xbox) for co-op; **folding stand** for tabletop sessions.

## Quick setup checklist

1) Update SteamOS and GPU drivers.  
2) Toggle Steam Cloud per game; download key titles offline.  
3) Add cloud apps (GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud) as Non-Steam shortcuts.  
4) Pack charger, hub, HDMI, and a controller for docked sessions.
