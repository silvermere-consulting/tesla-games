## Overview

**Stardew Valley** is a farm life sim where you rebuild a rundown farm, grow crops, raise animals, explore mines, and build relationships with townsfolk. It’s open-ended and extremely flexible – great for both long sessions and small “do a day or two” bursts. 

## Where you can play it

Stardew Valley is available on:

- **PC (Steam, GOG, etc.)**
- **Nintendo Switch**
- **PlayStation / Xbox**
- **Mobile (iOS / Android)**
- **Tesla Arcade** on some Tesla models, for in-car play. 

This makes it ideal if you want **one game** that follows you across multiple devices.

## Why it works on the move

- **Day-based structure** – play 1–3 in-game days when you have a spare 10–20 minutes.
- **Forgiving pacing** – no need for fast reactions, good after long days.
- **Cloud and cross-save options** differ by platform, so check per store:
  - PC → Steam cloud
  - Some console + PC combos support manual save transferring or unofficial tools.

## Tesla Arcade note (optional cluster)

If you have a supported Tesla, Stardew Valley is also playable via **Tesla Arcade**, making it one of the rare games you might touch in the car and then continue later on PC or console. Your Tesla game save is separate from PC/console saves, but the gameplay itself is essentially the same.

## Play it on…

- **Switch / Switch 2** – great if you want cosy handheld play on the sofa or in bed.
- **Steam Deck / handheld PC** – best if you already have the game on Steam.
- **PC / console** – largest screens, easiest couch co-op (split-screen).
- **Mobile** – if you want a “farm in your pocket” with touch controls.
