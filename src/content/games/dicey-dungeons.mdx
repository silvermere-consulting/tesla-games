## Overview

**Dicey Dungeons** is a light, fast roguelike where you become a walking dice and battle through dungeons using a mix of luck and build-craft. Each class plays differently, and runs are short, making it a great pick-up-and-play game for handhelds.

## Where you can play it

Dicey Dungeons is available on:

- **PC (Steam and other PC stores)**
- **Nintendo Switch**
- **Xbox / PlayStation** (in many regions)
- **Mobile** on some platforms

Because it’s turn-based and grid-like, it works well on:

- **Switch / handheld consoles** – perfect for short runs.
- **Steam Deck / handheld PCs** – low system requirements, very battery-friendly.
- **Laptops / desktops** for relaxed mouse/keyboard play.

## Why it works on the move

- **Short runs** – a single floor or challenge can fit into a few minutes.
- **Pausing is trivial** – no timing pressure between turns.
- **Simple visuals and low requirements** – ideal for lower-power handhelds.

## Things to know

- There’s RNG, but there’s also a lot of build depth; learning how to mitigate bad rolls is part of the fun.
- Each character class introduces different rules – expect a learning curve early on.
- The game is relatively small in download size, so it’s good for devices with limited storage.

## Play it on…

- **Switch** – ideal “curl up on the sofa” platform.
- **Steam Deck / handheld PC** – great if you already have a PC library.
- **Mobile / tablet** – if you prefer touch controls where available.
