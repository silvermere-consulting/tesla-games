## What it is

Vampire Survivors is a horde-survival roguelite where your hero auto-attacks while you steer, dodge, and draft upgrades. Runs last up to 30 minutes and snowball from fragile starts into screen-filling chaos with dozens of unlocks.

It is intentionally low-spec and fast to load, so it plays well on handheld PCs, Steam Deck, Switch, and modest laptops without sacrificing the "one more run" loop.

## Why it works on the move

- 10–30 minute runs fit commutes and hotel nights.
- Low-spec: smooth on Steam Deck, handheld PCs, and Switch.
- Simple inputs: stick + a couple of buttons; easy when tired.
- Tiny install; offline-friendly once downloaded.
