## Overview

**Gris** is a short, visually stunning platformer with light puzzle elements and no combat. It focuses on atmosphere, music, and storytelling rather than difficulty spikes, making it a great choice if you want something calmer than most action titles.

## Where you can play it

Gris is available on:

- **PC (Steam and other PC stores)**
- **Nintendo Switch**
- **PlayStation / Xbox** (varies by region)
- Some **mobile platforms**

It feels especially good on:

- **Switch / handheld consoles** – play in short bursts or finish in a weekend.
- **Steam Deck / handheld PCs** – comfy with a controller and headphones.
- **PC on a big screen** – to really enjoy the art direction.

## Why it works on the move

- **Short total length** – you can realistically complete it over a trip or a couple of evenings.
- **Generous checkpointing** – easy to pause and resume.
- **Low mechanical stress** – no twitch combat; fine for tired evenings.

## Things to know

- There’s little traditional “challenge” – Gris is about mood and experience.
- If you’re after high replayability or deep systems, this is more of a one-and-done.
- Bring headphones: the soundtrack is a big part of the experience.

## Play it on…

- **Switch / handheld console** – great portable art piece.
- **Steam Deck / handheld PC** – especially nice with OLED or good headphones.
- **PC / console on TV** – if you want the full cinematic experience.
