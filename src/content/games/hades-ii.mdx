## Overview

**Hades II** is a fast-paced action roguelike where you fight your way through the underworld in endlessly replayable runs. It builds on the original Hades with new weapons, gods, storylines, and systems, while keeping the tight combat and satisfying progression loop that made the first game so popular.

It’s a great fit for **short sessions** (one or two runs) as well as longer “just one more” evenings.

## Where you can play it

Hades II is available on:

- **PC (Steam / others)** – primary platform.
- **Handheld PCs (Steam Deck, ROG Ally, etc.)** via your PC store account.
- Future console releases are expected, but always check the latest store listings for platform availability.

On **Steam Deck and handheld PCs**, Hades II works well because:

- The moment-to-moment controls map nicely to a controller.
- Runs are self-contained, making it easy to play in shorter sessions.
- It’s forgiving of suspend/resume when you need to pause.

## Why it works on the move

- **Short run-based structure** – you can finish a run in a commute or charging stop.
- **Excellent controller support** – great on handheld PCs and docked setups.
- **Progress feels meaningful** – even failed runs usually unlock something.

## Things to know

- Fast reaction times help; if you prefer slower or turn-based games, this might feel intense.
- You can tweak difficulty somewhat via in-game options and boons.
- Expect to die a lot at first – that’s part of the design.

## Play it on…

- **Steam Deck / handheld PC** – likely the best portable experience.
- **Desktop / laptop PC** – for higher resolutions and long sessions.
- **TV setup** via docking or HDMI from PC/handheld.

> 💡 Tip: If you own both PC and a handheld PC (Steam Deck / ROG Ally), stick to the same store (e.g. Steam) so you can share progress between devices via cloud saves where supported.
