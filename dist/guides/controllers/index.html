While the car supports a limited set of USB and Bluetooth devices, playing the same games on PC, Switch, or other consoles opens up more options. This guide explains the most practical choices and why they matter.</p>

<h2 id="controllers-that-work-in-a-tesla">Controllers that work in a Tesla</h2>
<p>The Tesla Arcade supports most modern <strong>wired USB controllers</strong> and some <strong>Bluetooth models</strong>.<br/>
Popular options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Xbox Wireless Controller (USB-C or USB-A)</strong><br/>
Recognised quickly by Tesla vehicles and works reliably at home with PC or Xbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PlayStation DualSense (PS5)</strong><br/>
Compatible in wired mode. At home, it adds adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, features that Tesla games do not use but PC and PlayStation titles can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>8BitDo Pro 2</strong><br/>
A flexible third-party option with profiles for Switch, PC, Android, and more. Known for comfort and programmability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="using-the-same-controller-at-home">Using the same controller at home</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of starting with a Tesla-compatible controller is that you can continue using it outside the car. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Xbox Wireless Controller</strong> works seamlessly on PC (wired or Bluetooth), Xbox Series X/S, and cloud platforms like Xbox Game Pass.</li>
<li>The <strong>DualSense</strong> integrates best with PlayStation 5 but is increasingly supported on PC titles that use haptics and adaptive triggers.</li>
<li>The <strong>8BitDo Pro 2</strong> is a cross-platform device, making it an excellent choice if you switch between PC, Switch, and mobile.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it easy to carry your Tesla setup into a living room console or desktop environment without buying duplicates.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="recommendations-by-scenario">Recommendations by scenario</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you mainly play on PC and Tesla:</strong> Choose the Xbox Wireless Controller.</li>
<li><strong>If you own a PlayStation 5:</strong> Stick with the DualSense to benefit from features beyond Tesla.</li>
<li><strong>If you want maximum flexibility:</strong> Pick the 8BitDo Pro 2 for cross-platform use.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Tesla Arcade is limited in scope, but choosing a controller that also fits into your wider gaming setup saves money and adds convenience. Instead of buying something that works only in the car, it makes sense to invest in hardware you can continue using across multiple platforms.</p> <aside class="mt-8 p-4 border rounded-xl"> <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Helpful links</h2> <ul class="list-disc ml-6"> <li><a class="underline" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=xbox+wireless+controller&tag=gamelocnet-21" rel="sponsored nofollow">Xbox Wireless Controller</a></li><li><a class="underline" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=ps5+dualsense+controller&tag=gamelocnet-21" rel="sponsored nofollow">DualSense (PS5)</a></li><li><a class="underline" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=8bitdo+pro+2&tag=gamelocnet-21" rel="sponsored nofollow">8BitDo Pro 2</a></li> </ul> </aside> </article> </body></html>
